# COVID DATA EXPLORATION
My pet project that includes analysing COVID data(cases, deaths, vaccinations and more).
The goal is to explore data-exploration, manipulation and visualisation tools as much as possible, and also have some insights into the data itself, because it's always interesting:)

Project in initial stage, plans: more in-depth analysis and visualisation.
